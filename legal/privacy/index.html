        <h1>Able Pear Software and your privacy</h1>

        <p class="intro">This privacy statement is intended to outline how and what information is collected by Able
        Pear Software Incorporated ("Able Pear") when you chose to use our applications or by visiting ablepear.com
        ("Web Site"). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before using this Web Site. Able Pear assumes that if
        you use this Web Site, you have read, understood, and agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this
        Privacy Policy, you should not use this Web Site.</p>

        <p>Able Pear reserves the right to update or change this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. If Able
        Pear makes significant changes to this Policy, a notice will be posted on its homepage or alert you to such
        changes by other similar means. By continuing to use this Web Site, you agree to be bound by any such
        revisions. You should visit this page of the Web Site periodically and print the latest version of the Privacy
        Policy for your records. The last update date is stated at the bottom of this document.</p>

        <h2>1. What Information Able Pear Collects and How Able Pear Uses That Information</h2>

        <p><strong>Collection of Information</strong>: Able Pear does not collect any personally identifiable
        information from you (e.g., name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, etc.) unless you voluntarily
        choose to submit or otherwise disclose such information, including information submitted or disclosed by mail,
        telephone, fax, or electronically. Able Pear will not sell, trade, or rent your personally identifiable
        information to third parties. Able Pear will only use your information for its own analytical purposes and to
        respond to your request for information. If you wish to change any information submitted to Able Pear, please
        do so using the contact form on this Web Site.</p>

        <p><strong>Information for Children</strong>: Able Pear does not direct its Web Site to children under thirteen
        years of age. Individuals under eighteen years of age should consult with their parent or guardian about the
        use of this Web Site.</p>

        <p><strong>Monitoring, Enforcement and Legal Requests</strong>: Able Pear has no obligation to monitor this Web
        Site or the use of this Web Site, or to retain the content of any user session. However, Able Pear reserves the
        right at all times to monitor, review, retain, and/or disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any
        applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request or to cooperate with law enforcement and
        other authorities in investigating a claim of illegal activity. Able Pear may use IP addresses to identify a

        others.</p>

        <p><strong>Other Sites</strong>: Except as otherwise expressly discussed in this Privacy Policy, this policy
        only addresses Able Pear&acirc;&euro;&trade;s use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the

        information.</p>

        <h2>2. How Able Pear Protects Your Information</h2>

        <p><strong>Transmission Errors or Unauthorized Acts</strong>: Unfortunately, no data transmission over the
        Internet can be guaranteed to be secure. As a result, although Able Pear strives to protect your personal
        information, Able Pear cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit or any information
        provided online, and you do so at your own risk. Able Pear will not be liable for disclosures of your personal
        information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third parties. However, once Able Pear
        receives your transmission, reasonable efforts will be made to protect the information.</p>

        <p><strong>Security</strong>: Any information provided to Able Pear is treated with care and discretion. Able
        Pear will take reasonable measures to ensure the information is kept private and not misused.</p>
